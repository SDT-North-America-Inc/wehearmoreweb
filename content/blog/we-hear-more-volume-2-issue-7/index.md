## A Message from Allan Rienstra

> Join me on Wednesday, October 6th at 11AM ET for Ultrasound... Beyond the Essentials: Prescribing Bearing Lubrication Based on Friction, not Fiction!

> Machinery lubrication remains the single biggest factor in affecting and prolonging asset reliability. Getting it right contributes to a long, trouble-free service life. But get it wrong, as so many do, and expect unplanned breakdowns, reactive firefighting, drained resources, and a culture of unreliability.

> There was a time not too long ago, when machinery lubrication was a job performed by experts; By a person – or a team of people – who understood every asset’s complexity, and the effects lubrication had for each machine. The “Lube Technician” was arguably the most important contributor to reliability.

> Lube techs, with their finger on the pulse of the plant, administered the oily “life blood” which flowed through its veins. They understood what happened when this task was performed poorly. They knew that without control and discipline the chance to imbue precision results was scant. To get the most life possible from a machine they knew they had to “Grease Bearings Right.”
